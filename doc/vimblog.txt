ABOUT VIMBLOG                                                    *vimblog-about*

For Vi, Vim or GVim users, there is a simple way to manage your blog
posts.

In the Vim environment you can now:

  * Create new blog posts
  * Edit / posts
  * List all categories
  * List older posts
  * Promote turn "draft" posts into "published" (and vice-versa)
  * Upload media to your blog from within VIM and get a link to it
  * Mac+Wordpress+Chrome:  After using :Blog draft you can preview
    your draft with <Leader>p, \p by default.  Additionally, if you
    access a pre-existing post (Blog rp, then <CR> on a line with the ID
    in it), thereafter \p will launch the entry in Chrome.

In short, if you've been hanging on to Textmate for its blogging bundle,
you now have a comparable featureset in Vim thanks to Vimblog and
|GIFL|.

It is an out-of-the-box solution that works for Wordpress, but which can
very easilly, be customized to manage Blogger, MovableType, TextPattern,
et al.  Its the beauty of Open Source software. Study the code, change
it, and use it. It is very safe to use it because unlike proprietary
software, you can check for "phone\_home" procedures, etc.

VIMBLOG CONFIGURATION                                    *vimblog-configuration*
                                                               *g:vimblogConfig*

You must define the configuration in your ~/.vimrc by defining a
dictionary (aka a Hash) called g:vimblogConfig.


g:vimblogConfig = {
  'login': '*username*', 
  'passwd': '*pw*', 
  'site': '*yoursite*', 
  'xml_rpc_path': '/xmlrpc.php', 
  'port': '80', 
  'image_style': '*classes you want to add to images*'
}

                                                                 
USING VIMBLOG                                                    *vimblog-usage*

Vimblog functions are invoked from the : prompt and the keyword
"Blog".  Thus :Blog np will allow you to create a new post, :Blog rp
will fetch recent posts.  :Blog help will also display this help menu.

  :blog rp [x]    => show recent [x] posts"
  :blog gp id     => get post with identification id"
  :blog np        => create a new post"
  :blog um file   => upload media asset [path to asset]"
  :blog publish   => publish an edited/new post"
  :blog draft     => save edited/new post as draft"
  :blog gc        => get the list of categories"
  :blog del id    => delete post with identification id"
  :blog help      => this message"
